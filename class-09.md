# Events

An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does, JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements: 

`<element event='some JavaScript'>`

when press on the button it make action.

Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked).

When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because
it has responded to the user.
