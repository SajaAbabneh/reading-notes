# Text 

**When creating a web page, you add tags to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.**

* **Structural markup:** the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.

* **Semantic markup** : which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation.

# Heading 

**HTML has six "levels" of headings , The contents of an <h1 element is the largest, and the contents of an <h6 element is the smallest.**

# Paragraph 

**To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p
tag and closing </p tag.**


# Bold & Italic 

**By enclosing words in the tags <b and </b we can make characters appear bold.**

**By enclosing words in the tags <i and </i we can make characters appear italic.**

# Superscript & Subscript

* **<sup** : The <sup element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power.

* **<sub** : The <sub element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical
formulas .

# White Space

**When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as ***white space collapsing*****.

# Line Break
**if you wanted to add a line break inside the
middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag <br.**

# Horizantal Rule

**To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the <hr tag.**

# Semantic markup

**There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the
pages.**

# Strong tag

**The use of the <strong  element indicates that its content has ***strong importance.*****

# emphasis tag

**The <em element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.**

# Blockquote tag

**The <blockquote element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph**.

**The <q element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph.**

**The <abbr tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation oracronym when you mouse over the element.**

# Citations tag

**The <cite tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture),The text in the <cite element usually renders in ***italic*****.

# Defintion tag 

**The <dfn tag stands for the "definition element", and it specifies a term that is going to be defined within the content.**

# Address tag

**The <address element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of
the page.**

# ins and del tag 

**The <ins element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while
the <del element can show text that has been deleted from it.**

# S tag

**The <s element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted).**

# CSS

**CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a ***selector and a declaration*****.

![css](image2/css.png)

**CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.**
