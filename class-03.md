# SWITCH STATEMENTS 

**A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.** 

![syntaxswitch](./image2/switch.png)

* The switch expression is evaluated once.

* The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.

* If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.

* If there is no match, the default code block is executed.


***At the end of each case is the break keyword.***

**The Different between If-statement and Switch**

The if statement evaluates integer, character, pointer or floating-point type or boolean type. On the other hand, switch statement evaluates only character or an integer datatype.

# Loops

**Loops chech the condition, if it true a code block will run, then the condition will be checked again if it still true the code block will run again, it repeated until the condition return false.**

## For Loop

**if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.**

* Initialization : var i=0;

* condition : i < 10;

* statements;

* update : i++ 

### You will commonly see these two keywords used with loops:

* **Break** :  causes the termination of the loop and tells the interpreter to go onto the next statement of code outside of the loop.

* **Continue** :  tells the interpreter to continue with the current iteration, and then check the condition again.

## While loop

**loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.**

## Syntax

while(condition)

{

    statements;

}

## Do While loop

**will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.**

## Syntax

do

{

    statements;
} while(condition);

# Lists

###  HTML provides us with three different types:

* **Ordered lists** are lists where each item in the list is numbered.

![Order](./image3/order.png)
![orderalpha](./image3/order2.png)
![nestedorder](./image3/nesorder.png)

* **Unordered lists** are lists that begin with a bullet point .

![unorder](./image3/unorder.png)
![nestedunorder](./image3/nesunorder.png)


* **Definition lists** are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

![Definitionlist](./image3/dfn.png)

* Use the HTML **<dl** element to define a description list.

* Use the HTML **<dt** element to define the description term.

* Use the HTML **<dd** element to describe the term in a description list.

# Box Dimensions

**The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.**

## Border width

* border style

![borderstyle](./image3/type.png)

* border width

* border color

* indivisual border side

## Padding

**properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.**

![padding](./image3/padding.png)

## Margin 
**properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.**

![margin](./image3/margin.png)

## Centering Content

**If you want to center a box on the page (or center it inside the element that it sits in).**

![centerbox](./image3/center.png)

## inline

**This causes a block-level element to act like an inline element.**

![inline](./image3/in.png)

## Image border

## Box shadow

## Border radius
