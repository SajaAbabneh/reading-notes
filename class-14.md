An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

### The @keyframes Rule

When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times.

The **animation-duration** property defines how long time an animation should take to complete.

The **animation-delay** property specifies a delay for the start of an animation.

The **animation-iteration-count** property specifies the number of times an animation should run.
